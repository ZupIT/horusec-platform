This module will bring together all the **Horusec Platform** e2e tests using the [**cypress**](https://docs.cypress.io) tool.

## Structure

- **Fixture folder** - This folder stores all static data that will be used as a *mock*
- **Integration folder** - Here all test cases will be gathered
- **Plugins folder** - The Plugins API allows you to hook into and extend Cypress behavior. [read more about plugins](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin)
- **Support folder** - This files runs before every single spec file. We do this purely as a convenience mechanism so you don't have to import this file in every single one of your spec files.
